As I mentioned from Monday's assignment:

Entities:
    Assignments
    Maybe grades
Use Cases:
    Students
    Instructors
    Admin

Slices:
    The admin adding / removing people
        Needs admin, an interface for seeing, adding, removing people
    Instructor viewing submissions by assignment
        Need some way to get metadata about assignment, and to talk to DB to get list
        of students, list of assignment submissions and/or grades for them
    Instructor adding assignments
        Needs to allow Instructor input/output for assignments, as well as setting
        date, points, desc & name, etc. Also maybe have removing assignments in here too
    Student submitting assignment
        Definitely a whole slice dedicated to student submissions. This will involve uploading
        some code, sending it off, getting it graded and returned to them
    Student viewing unsubmitted assignments
        Needs to get assignments for which the student hasn't submitted anything
    Student viewing grades
        Kind of mirrors unsubmitted assignments, but a student needs to get the information
        for assignments they have submitted.

Outer layer:
    Some sort of UI (Flutter/dart probably)
    Database (JSON? SQL? No-SQL online DB?)
    Some way to input / output files, both from the instructor
        and the code that the student submits to be compiled
