Dart & Flutter is a pretty powerful framework that I've used before and
am planning to use for this project. I've been trying to think about how
it fits into our dependency graph, especially with things like state
management. The GUI pages are pretty simple, they are purely outside
details. The mental struggle I'm running into is where to things like
Blocs and Cubits fall? Bloc stands for Business Logic Component, so that
sounds a lot like the use case, which handles the flow of logic from the
other components in a slice. The Cubits are essentially the Data providers
that push the data to the front-end. The problem with this structure that
I'm trying to think through is that now our components are technically
dependent on our framework, but I don't know if there's a way around that
using an effective state management tool with Flutter.

I found an interesting article that seems to help, but it still seems very
Flutter-structured, which I guess that's the choice that we had to make when
going for Flutter
